      Once upon a time in the bustling city of Culinary Haven, where flavors from around the world danced in the air, I, an aspiring chef named Alex, 
    embarked on a culinary adventure that would forever change my approach to cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
      One sunny afternoon, while strolling through the vibrant farmers' market, I stumbled upon a quaint booth. It was run by an eccentric elderly man named Chef Marvolo,
    who had traveled the world in search of unique and exotic flavors. He had a twinkle in his eye and a contagious passion for creating exceptional dishes.
  </p>
  <p>
      Intrigued by the display of uncommon meats, I approached Chef Marvolo and struck up a conversation. He shared his expertise in using bison meat, an ingredient 
    not widely utilized in mainstream culinary culture. He recounted tales of its lean nature and subtly sweet taste, which had captured his gastronomic curiosity.
    Inspired by his tales and armed with newfound knowledge, I set out to craft my own bison meatball recipe. I wanted to blend the essence of traditional flavors with a 
    touch of modern innovation, staying true to my culinary roots.
  </p> 
  <p>
      After hours of experimentation and several attempts, I finally concocted the perfect blend of spices, breadcrumbs, and other elements that would complement the unique 
    qualities of bison meat. The resulting recipe was a harmonious symphony of flavors, a fusion of culinary traditions and contemporary techniques. Excited to share my discovery
    with the world, I opened a small bistro named "Bison Bites" in the heart of Culinary Haven. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The bison meatball dish became an instant hit, drawing locals and tourists alike to savor this newfound gastronomic delight. And thus, my culinary journey continued, 
    fueled by the magic of unexpected encounters and the joy of creating delightful dishes that would leave a lasting mark on all who tasted them.

  </u1>
  <br>
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <o1>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground bison meat, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped onion, minced garlic, milk, egg, 
              salt, black pepper, dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
    <li>Take small portions of the mixture and roll them into meatballs. The size is up to your preference, but typically, they are about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat and add a little olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Place the meatballs in the hot skillet, making sure not to overcrowd them. You may need to cook them in batches if your pan is not large enough.</li>
    <li>Brown the meatballs on all sides, turning them as needed. This should take about 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the meatballs are nicely browned, transfer them to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until they are cooked through.</li>
    <li>Bison meat is lean, so be careful not to overcook them to prevent them from becoming dry.</li>
    <li>Serve the bison meatballs with your favorite sauce or pasta, or use them as appetizers.</li>
